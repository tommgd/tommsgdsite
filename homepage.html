    Hello! My name, is Tommy, or tomm as I'm usually referred to when it comes down to Geometry Dash. 
    This site is purely dedicated to ranking all of my demon completions beyond my Google Sheets ranking, since this is a more convenient way of seeing how I rank my levels, as well as me adding a brief analysis detailing my experience with the level and what I liked/disliked about each one, which is a much tougher task through Google Sheets.
