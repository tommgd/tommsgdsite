        Hello! My name, is Tommy, or tomm as I'm usually referred to when it comes down to Geometry Dash.<br>
        This site is purely dedicated to ranking all of my demon completions beyond my Google Sheets ranking, 
        since this is a more convenient way of seeing how I rank my levels.<br> I will also be adding a brief analysis 
        detailing my experience with the level and what I liked/disliked about each one, which is a much tougher 
        task through Google Sheets.
    </p>
